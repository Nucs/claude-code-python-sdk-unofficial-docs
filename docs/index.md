# Claude Agent SDK Documentation

> **Comprehensive technical reference for the Claude Agent SDK (Python & TypeScript)**

The Claude Agent SDK is a framework for building autonomous AI agents powered by Anthropic's Claude models. This documentation provides complete coverage of the SDK's architecture, APIs, integration patterns, and production deployment strategies.

## Documentation Structure

### Core Documentation

#### [Overview](overview.md)
Introduction to the Claude Agent SDK, including historical context, core capabilities, architecture overview, and comparison with alternative frameworks.

#### [Getting Started](getting-started.md)
Installation instructions, prerequisites, environment configuration, and quick start tutorials for both Python and TypeScript implementations.

#### [Architecture](architecture.md)
Deep technical analysis of the SDK's internal systems: agent loop implementation, context management, tool execution framework, subagent architecture, hook system, and MCP integration layer.

#### [API Reference](api-reference.md)
Complete API documentation for all functions, classes, and type definitions:
- `query()` - Stateless task execution
- `ClaudeSDKClient` - Stateful conversation management
- `ClaudeAgentOptions` - Configuration system
- `@tool` decorator - Custom tool development
- `create_sdk_mcp_server()` - MCP server creation
- Hook system and event handling
- Error types and handling

### Tools & Integration

#### [Tools and MCP](tools-and-mcp.md)
Built-in tools (Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob, WebFetch), custom tool development patterns, and comprehensive coverage of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) ecosystem with 500+ server integrations across productivity, development, data, and cloud platforms.

---

### Production & Deployment

#### [Production Patterns](production-patterns.md)
Enterprise deployment models, CLAUDE.md configuration management, security configurations (SAML, OIDC, VPC), headless automation, CI/CD integration, monitoring, observability, and cost management strategies.

#### [Security](security.md)
Security architecture, permission-based controls, known vulnerabilities (prompt injection, command injection, access control), mitigation strategies, OAuth 2.1 authentication, secure prompting practices, and compliance frameworks.

#### [Performance Optimization](performance-optimization.md)
Benchmark results (77.2% SWE-bench Verified score), model comparison analysis, pricing structures ($3/$15 per million tokens), cost optimization techniques (prompt caching, dynamic routing, context compaction), and performance tuning strategies.

---

### Support & Resources

#### [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md)
Common issues and solutions: import errors, API configuration, tool errors, async runtime problems, context limits, permission issues, MCP connection failures, debugging techniques, and error code reference.

#### [Real-World Use Cases](real-world-use-cases.md)
Documented implementations across 18 organizations including Notion, Canva (240M users), Figma, JetBrains, GitHub Actions (70% efficiency gains), Harvey Legal, Hai Security (44% faster analysis), CrowdStrike, Ramp Financial, and Anthropic internal tools (3x debugging speed).

#### [Community Resources](community-resources.md)
Official resources (documentation, repositories, Discord), community projects (awesome lists, example repositories, integration libraries), tutorials, video content, blog posts, conference talks, and open-source contributions.
