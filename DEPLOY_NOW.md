## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Error: "authentication failed"
- Use Personal Access Token, not password
- Token needs `repo` and `workflow` scopes

### Error: "permission denied"
- Check you have write access to the repository
- Verify repository URL is correct

### Error: "remote already exists"
- Run: `git remote remove origin`
- Then re-run the deploy script

### Build fails in GitHub Actions
- Check `.github/workflows/docs.yml` exists
- Verify `requirements.txt` is complete
- Check Actions tab for error details
